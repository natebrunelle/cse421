## Juliette Park

Hello!
My name is Juliette and I’m majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Slavic Literatures. I do research at the Sauro Lab and build websites for Web Impact. Outside school, I love to be a grandma (buy cardigans, make tea, and read) and give my dog kisses. I really look forward to the quarter and what you will all achieve!  

## Charles Hamilton-Eppler

Hey, all! Charles here. This is my second time TA-ing 332 and my third time overall. In my free time, I like to go hiking and take photos. Excited to meet you all!

## Chandni Rajasekaran

Hi! My name is Chandni and I am currently a BS/MS student majoring in computer science. I am super excited to TA this course for the sixth time, since I've come to see that everything I've learned in this class has been very applicable to internship preparation. Outside of school, I really enjoy drawing and baking. As a shameless plug, I have an instagram account where I post my photorealistic color pencil drawings (username: @chandnidraws). I can't wait to meet everyone this quarter!

## Hana Smahi

I love exploring the outdoors of the PNW through hiking, cycling, paddle boarding, and nature photography. I’m also an avid swimmer, reader, and a huge fan of comedy tv-shows (I’ve watched the office 8 times – and I’m itching to watch it again, don’t judge me). Feel free to reach out if you have any related questions or just want to chat!

Outside of school, I love listening to music (especially 90’s alternative/rock – I’m a huge fan of RHCP, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Green Day, etc.), playing my guitars, teaching karate, hanging out with my dog (Leo), and reading new books.  So excited to meet all of you! :)
