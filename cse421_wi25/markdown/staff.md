Hello, Iâ€™m a BS/MS student, first time TAing CSE 421. Outside of CS, I'm a big basketball fan, so in my free time I like to follow the NBA a lot - favorite team being Lakers. Excited to be a TA for this class!

## Jonathan Ly

Hello everyone, I'm Jonathan! I'm a fourth year student majoring in computer science. This will be my second time TAing for CSE 421, and I look forward to working with you all! I'm broadly interested in (almost) everything CS theory and mathematics. In my own time, I also game, collect miniatures, and read. I'm always happy to talk about specific topics about this course or otherwise. And I hope everyone will enjoy the course as much as I did!

## Grant Tannert

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Grant. I'm from Jakarta, Indonesia and this is my 5th year studying CS at UW. I enjoy playing basketball, skiing, valorant (I hit ascendant ðŸ˜¤), watching movies, ... (the list goes on). This is my first quarter TAing and I am excited to be here. Looking forward to the quarter with you all!

## Owen Boseley

Hey! My name is Owen and I'll be one of your TAs for this coming quarter! I've been TAing for over 6 quarters now, and consider 421 one of my favorite courses. In the classroom my hobbies include theory, instilling a deep love of learning in my students, talking about random niche topics in cs, and telling bad dad jokes in section. Out of the classroom, I love to run, listen to music, play puzzle games, read, and eat a little too much food. Hoping to make this YOUR favorite quarter yet. :)

## Glenn Sun

Hi everyone, I'm Glenn, a 2nd year PhD student in CS Theory. This is my third time TA'ing 421 and I'm excited to help everyone! Beyond math and CS, I like to cook, play games (both video and board), and go on casual bike rides. Ask me anything about 421, grad school, or whatever else!

## Edward Qin

Hi everyone, I'm Edward! I'm very excited to TA for CSE 421 for the second time. I really enjoyed this class for the foundational algorithms you learn and all the fun problems it exposes you to! Outside of school, I enjoy playing cello and taking walks in new areas. Looking forward to working with you this quarter!

## Atri Banerjee

Hey, I'm Atri! I'm a senior majoring in CS with a minor in Philosophy. Outside of school I like to read, cook, watch movies and play video games. I'm excited to have a great quarter with you all!

## Weizi Wu

Hello! I'm Weizi! I'm a junior double majoring in CS and ACMS. This is my first time being a TA. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing sports. If you have any questions about anything or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me! I'll do my best to help!

## Ajay Harilal

Hey everyone! My name is Ajay, and this is my second time TAing CSE421! Previously, I've TAed CSE122 and 123 for 6 quarters. But Algorithms has been my favorite class that I've taken at UW, so I have always wanted to TA for it as well! Outside of school, I love watching soccer âš½ and running! Recently, I've been trying to cook a lot, albeit with very questionable results... I look forward to meeting you all this quarter!

## Robert Stevens

Hi, I'm Robert! I'm a senior and I'm excited to be TAing 421 for my 3rd quarter. I'm interested in CS theory and math but especially algorithms and probability. If you have any questions about math, undergraduate research, or being a transfer student feel free to reach out!
