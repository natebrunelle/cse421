All tasks will be submitted and graded on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/939663).

# Homework

Links to homeworks will be posted here as they are released (typically Wednesday evenings). Please review our [homework guide](/homeworkguide.html) for requirements and suggestions on writing up your submissions.

# Exams

Your midterm exam will be at 6:00pm-7:30pm on Wednesday February 19 in lieue of a normal class meeting. If you anticipate conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle know during the first week of class.

Your final exam will occur at 2:30pm on Monday March 17. Because the course scheduled into the final exam block after ours does not have a final exam, you will have until 5:20pm to take the exam. Again, if you have anticipated conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle know during the first week of class.
