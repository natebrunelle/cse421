All tasks will be submitted and graded on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/939663).

# Homework

Links to homeworks will be posted here as they are released (typically Wednesday evenings). Please review our [homework guide](/homeworkguide.html) for requirements and suggestions on writing up your submissions.

## Homework 1: Stable Matching and Proof Writing

In the homework you will be asked to:

1. reason about the properties of stable matchings
1. adapt to generalizations of assumptions made for inputs to the Gale-Shapley algorithm
1. apply an inductive argument

The problem statements can be found in [this pdf](files/homework/homework1_problems.pdf).

You may draft your solutions in Overleaf using this [LaTeX template](files/homework/homework1-template.tex) (preferred), in a document (please use the equation editor for all math notation), or hand-written (so long as you are able to do so neatly). To use the template, download it by clicking the link, then re-upload it to an Overleaf project, then change the compiler to XeLaTeX within the menu (the button in the top-left corner of the page with the Overleaf logo).

You will submit your solutions to gradescope. Keep in mind that you have a distinct gradescope assignment per problem. Since this assignment has 3 problems, there are 3 distinct gradescope submissions you must make.

Happy problem solving!

## Homework 2: Asymptotics and Graph Search

In this homework you will be asked to:

1. Compare the asymptotic growth rates of functions
1. Adapt graph search procedures (BFS and DFS) into novel algorithms.

The problem statements can be found in [this pdf](files/homework/homework2_problems.pdf).

You may draft your solutions in Overleaf using this [LaTeX template](files/homework/homework2-template.tex) (preferred), in a document (please use the equation editor for all math notation), or hand-written (so long as you are able to do so neatly).

You will submit your solutions to gradescope. Keep in mind that you have a distinct gradescope assignment per problem. Since this assignment has 4 problems, there are 4 distinct gradescope submissions you must make.

Happy problem solving!

# Exams

Your midterm exam will be at 6:00pm-7:30pm on Wednesday February 19 in lieue of a normal class meeting. If you anticipate conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle know during the first week of class.

Your final exam will occur at 2:30pm on Monday March 17. Because the course scheduled into the final exam block after ours does not have a final exam, you will have until 5:20pm to take the exam. Again, if you have anticipated conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle know during the first week of class.
